= Boost.RunTimeServices

Boost.Capy is a small C++11 library for collecting optional runtime services, starting them in order, and stopping them safely. It is friendly to embedded targets (optional exceptions/RTTI) and aims to keep compile times low.

What it provides:

* Type-based service registry (`boost::rts::polystore`).
* Two-phase lifecycle management (`start`/`stop`) via `boost::rts::application`.
* Optional compression helpers (brotli/zlib) you can expose as services.

Why use it:

* Works with and without exceptions or RTTI.
* Designed for small hosts: minimal templates, fast builds.

== Requirements

* C++11 or later; CI covers GCC 5–15, Clang 3.9–20 (incl. Apple Clang), and MSVC 14.34+.
* Exceptions and RTTI are optional; APIs throw when enabled and rely on error codes otherwise.
* Depends on Boost (headers plus `boost::system`/`throw_exception`/`assert`); `find_package(Boost COMPONENTS rts REQUIRED)` in CMake.
* Optional codec helpers link to Zlib and/or Brotli if those features are enabled.

* Doing real work? See xref:guides/registering-services.adoc[Register and access services] and xref:guides/injection.adoc[Inject dependencies].
